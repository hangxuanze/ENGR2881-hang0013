# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'forward secrecy in encryption algorithms'
BEGIN:ac
It is the security attribute of communication protocol in cryptography, which means that the long-term master key leakage will not lead to the past session key leakage. Forward security can protect the past communication from the threat of password or key exposure in the future. If the system has forward security, it can ensure the security of historical communication when the master key is leaked, even if the system is attacked actively
