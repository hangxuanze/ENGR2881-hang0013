# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'political/commercial impacts on digital security'
BEGIN:ab
digital security includes government digital security and enterprise digital security
Government digital security involves state secrets and public interests
Enterprise digital security involves business secrets and enterprise rights and interests
If any aspect of digital security is not handled properly, it will ultimately affect political security, social stability and national prosperity and decline.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'forward secrecy in encryption algorithms'
BEGIN:ac
It is the security attribute of communication protocol in cryptography, which means that the long-term master key leakage will not lead to the past session key leakage. Forward security can protect the past communication from the threat of password or key exposure in the future. If the system has forward security, it can ensure the security of historical communication when the master key is leaked, even if the system is attacked actively

Chrome's address bar defaults to HTTPS
As early as the chrome 68 era, Google browser experimented with the "secure hypertext protocol" (HTTPS) version of the default display URL, rather than the already insecure "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" (HTTP). In the twinkling of an eye, in 2021, Google is brewing another change to chrome - the default boot to a secure http address. At the same time, it hides irrelevant parts (such as www. prefix) on the omnibox.
Since the spread of HTTPS, Google browser has been trying to hide secure parts of the URL, such as https://www. Such prefixes.
However, after typing 9to5google.com and pressing enter, older browsers may not use htpps connections as users would like.
The good news is, according to C hrome://flags With new tags added to the settings options and new posts on the problem tracker page, Google seems to be intent on changing the "default priority" of the address bar in the coming months.
In other words, when users enter a web address without a protocol version in the multi-function address bar, Chrome browser will default to the HTTPS version instead of the insecure HTTP connection.
