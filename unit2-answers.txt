## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can result in a `broken pipe' condition.
ab=t
# Question 'ac': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language sets the address of a network socket
ac=f

ad=t
# Question 'ae': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can be used to write data to a socket.
ae=f
# Question 'af': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language can be called by either the initiator or receiver of a socket connection.
af=t
# Question 'ag': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language causes a socket to actively connect via the network to listen for applications that require it.
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language marks a socket as `passive', ready to accept new connections.
